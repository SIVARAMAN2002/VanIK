Reviews for Kalam Hot Kitchen Restaurant A/c:
Review 1:
The worst experience I bought chicken rice and chilly chicken, but its not an chicken rice only chilly powder and chickem skin is there very disapointed and chilly chicken very very hard chicks after eating it creats smotach burminh that much raw chilly powder there were scaming peoples üòë

Review 2:
Out of frustration I have to share my feedback. I haven't ate such a worst fried rice anywhere. Rice should have been mixed with Chilli power not more than that. PLEASE DON'T ORDER FOR YOUR KIDS THEY MIGHT START HATING fired rice. I called the hotel the moment they picked up the phone the reply was very rude meanwhile I did not even address my concern. Later, I had to disconnect the call. Kalam Hot Kitchen near Krishna Nagar is good though.

Review 3:
There is no queue, they only prioritize swiggy, zomato. Customers are disliked, they made me wait for 30 minutes. Also, they ready the orders which were taken after me. Very bad experience.

Review 4:
* Chilli chicken was good. Quantity was sufficient but quality and packaging was not up-to-the-mark.
* Biryani was average but worth for price on budget.
* Chicken Manchurian was average. Could've made better!

Review 5:
Ordered fried rice and grill chicken .. Fried rice was dry and I was not able to finish fully . Grill chicken flavor is not up to the mark .could have been better . Staff are courteous

I have ordered for my family function a couple of times. Food taste is better. And cost wise also very affordable.

Review 4:
Food tastes good.
Taking too much time to get our food.
Need to improve to handle the orders. They are confused with online orders and dine orders. Mostly they have to give priority to online orders.

Review 5:
I bought the lunch meals cost of 90 rs and paneer 65 with cost of 100 rs. Taste wise good.

Reviews for Sangeetha Veg Restaurant:
Review 1:
Wonderful veg restaurant chain.
Tried onion rava dosa - Good! üëçüèº
Basundi & rasa malaai available.

Parking could be a problem if crowded.

Review 2:
Wonderful restaurant... The staff there are absolutely friendly and respectful. I went with my friend and tried cashew nut pulav, butter naan, aloo gobi masala, rasmalai and fruit salad with ice cream(must try). Awesome food quality and quantity. Good worth for the price they quote. The ambience here is absolutely good. Good place for the kids to enjoy and a well dignified place for the families to enjoy together.

Review 3:
This chain of restaurants was my favourite restaurant.. but the restaurant in this location i doesn‚Äôt like it .. we family of 4went for lunch and we see many tables with No service.. and no one wants to bother to greet us .. and I have to go and speak to the person we need seat .. the food was also not great .. the Sambar and Karakulambu lacked the sangeetha punch .. very disappointed

Review 4:
Here the sambhar rice used to be so yummy, i mostly Zomato sambhar rice and meals.
But today, sambhar rice tastes horribly sweet, the veg corn soup wasn't tasty, the meals was unforgettableüò£ the kovaka had no salt wasn't fully cooked, rasam was not good, chapati and kurma was good. They broke my heartüíî with the sweet sambhar rice I'm never ordering again from Sangeetha ‚òπÔ∏è.
Service was super good.

Review 5:
The food we had was below par. Soup was not good, and Plain Dosa that I had  itself was not crispy, and Sambar lacked the taste. The washroom was in a pathetic state with taps not working properly, water not flowing in the sink and dryer not working


Reviews for Shri Balaajee Bhavan:
Review 1:
We did a family party at the party hall here. We received several compliments from our guest regarding taste and quality of the food. They didn‚Äôt compromised the food quality and customer service were top notch. I highly recommend this place for the family function party.  It was less burden for the host to coordinate the food catering guys and getting all the materials needed instead we used their food service, which was very delicious. We will highly recommend this place compare to any other place in that area.

Review 2:
First of all hats off to staffs working thereüëèüëè.  There service was at a different level with zero error on quality.

We were a big crowd with kids and still were able to complete our food in an hour and 15 with good hospitality.

Some of the things you wanna try are, chola puri, Podi dosa, garlic dosa, ghee dosa and lime soda was perfect at the end.

One downside there is no reservation for AC room as the crowd keeps flowing.

Best part is even with the huge crowd and lot of tension the staffs were humble to accept few jokesüëçüëç.

Review 3:
Taste of food was really good, if you go to 10.00pm you only get Dosa items so if you want to visit late night you didn't get what you want.

I am really feeling bad about their service at table.
No one care about the customer simply they are taking orders and supply not get back.

Review 4:
Us, a family of four ate breakfast here and all of us were satisfied with the restaurant. We each got our ordered dishes quite fast, and the food was of genuinely good quality. Everything was tasty and cooked in a homelike way. A little pricey, but well worth it in our opinion. Service was prompt and friendly, and the ac hall was a very comfortable place to eat. Would visit again!

Review 5:
Balajee Bhavan restaurant is one of the busiest¬† restaurants in Chrompet. This is the first time I am trying, but it was a very good experience overall. We tried poori, set dosa, masala dosa, chapati¬†and coffee. All were good in taste and the quantity was also good. We liked their poori with vadakari combo which gave a superb combination and taste was good. Our least favorite dish which we didn't like is Chapathi, it was so hard and also not good. We were sitting in the roof top¬†area (open terrace - typically telling :) ), it was a wide area without any major set up. We thoroughly¬†enjoyed it, and of course our kids enjoyed that environment. Only one thing I want you to consider is coffee, actually they don't have any set up on the roof top to prepare coffee. So, if you are a coffee lover and prefer to consume something hot, then you need to rethink before you order. Because of the travel time (from ground floor to the top floor), we can get warm coffee only and not the hot coffee. But the coffee was good in taste, aroma - but I prefer to be hot. Parking is a bit challenging during the peak hours, but if you are coming in two wheeler you can manage. Ambience is very good, service can be improved.


Reviews for New Raga Restaurant:
Review 1:
Frequent visitor. The food here is flavourful & appetizing. Must drop in place for those who want a food with high standard &  reasonable price

Review 2:
A vegetarian place, more like dine and dash place. Popular dishes in here are dosa, idli and pooris, along with fried items like bonda, Vada and masala Vada.

The price of a dosa is usually Rs.30. Based on seats available 20 min. Is all you need to some here.

Review 3:
Good food vegetarian only ....
Easy access from tambaram mudichur road.
If you check for budget meals this restaurant is suitable for you

Review 4:
Good small place, tasty food, affordable price.

Review 5:
It's very tasty.


Reviews for Meat & Eat Family Restaurant:
Review 1:
A good restaurant, worth the price, items were crispy & up to the taste.

Review 2:
Peri peri fries and paneer fries was good. But the quantity was very small for a large option.

Review 3:
Yes it's a new small but well decorated hub for family and friends.. it's near to hastinapuram bus stand.
They are giving burgers in really less price... One small veg burger is cost around ‚Çπ25 only.. where as chicken burger is ‚Çπ65. But they give the same bun for both, difference is the patty and stuffings..
They are selling crispy fried chicken,, but it was oily, and not up to the mark of taste..May they are only concentrate on cost cutting not on the quality..
The good part i think the ketchup tower, for that u don't need to ask more and more satchet of ketchup.
Overall it's good to have some burgers sandwichs.
They r also selling mojito.better you can try these as your taste
Follow us on zomato @food_pervs

Review 4:
We ordered fried chicken with mojito and chicken wings. Total costs nearly 370.
The wings were old and seems to be shrinked one. Quantity was too less. Dont go if u concern about quality and quantity

Review 5:
Good and nice, realy better to kfc chicken.


Reviews for Amma Restaurants:
Review 1:
We went at 1.30 PM and thought of having meals, but even at that time the meals were over. So many people came for meals and they left the place. So we had Mixed veg and non veg fried rice. The taste was good and there was a sufficient quantity. The price could have been a little less, but it's fine.

Review 2:
Great place for evening coffee and bajjis. They serve really good coffee.

Review 3:
I ordered a chicken biryani for takeaway here. I got a really big bowl of aromatic biryani with large chunks of chicken, an egg, onion raita and another side dish. It was cooked with whole spices. The downside is that the egg was a little overcooked and the chicken meat a little tough but it's still good value for the price. I would definitely visit again.

Review 4:
Good veg and non-veg restaurant in the locality. Moderate rate and good in taste. Not much costly when compare with same kind of restaurants. I've seen many of the customers likes takeaway than dine-in. The dine-in facility to be improved to cover family customers. Revised comment after visiting on Oct 29 '2022 : they have developed the restaurant and expanded the dine in facility. Good ambience and taste wise as usual improved quality

Reviews for Sri Ganesh Bhavan:
Review 1:
Best veg restaurant around Tambaram with different varieties. Taste vise good try to visit in house. Because online costlier. Try to visit directly. Mini idly and curd vada is ulti. Mini idly best with their sambar. Rava dosa also best with their chutney and sambar.

Review 2:
I'm one of the customers of this hotel from the date they opened it in this place. Previously it was near the mathi tea stall near MR theatre and mudichur road corner. After the bridge construction started then this hotel opened in the back side of MR theatre. Until now they maintain the same taste of the food and with quality and quantity. My one of the favourite hotels in Tambaram.

Review 3:

Reviews for Hot Chips Veg Restaurant:
Review 1:
The restaurant was a go to food chain a few years ago.
Many say that their quality has dipped, but I don't think so.
Atleast, not this branch.
Best coffee you can get in the Tambaram area.
Tiffin quality is good too.

Review 2:
I was ordered food in Hot chips tambaram‚Ä¶panner fried rice and mini meals
Worst mini meals i had, taste was very bad like local food
Panner fried rice quantity is very less for 175Rs

Review 3:
Order for Meals and Mini Meals during Lunch, got Pongal instead which was served in a name of white rice.. Sambar, Rasam was ok.. Lemon rice was again like kichidi.. They served curd in a paper cup, don't know their logic.. Not worth for Rs.133.. Better we can have in road side Thallu vandi for better Lunch..üòîüòîüòî

Review 4:
Not a great place. Self service and a poor one. The food quality is much to be desired. The costs are too high for the taste.

I had experienced various hot chips restaurants long ago. But it seems, that the restaurant has lost its sheen. Not even value for money.

Review 5:
Quite expensive for a self service restaurant
Quality & quantity is fine
Dahi Poori is good ‚Çπ80 6 Pieces. Phulka + Paneer Butter Masala combo is worth ‚Çπ135


Reviews for KUMARAKOM THE RESTAURANT:
Review 1:
After the pandemic the location moved from velacherry prime area to the other side. The building is small place with very little table. The service is good and could see fee old employees too. The taste is definitely gone down. The prices have not changed much. They need to comeback by moving to a different location and focusing on the taste like the olden days.

Review 2:
Food is tasty. Good quality. Neat packing. Price little bit on the higher side. Typical Kerala taste.

Review 3:
I paid 250 for this food , total waste of money. Inedible

Review 4:
worst experience..this restaurant spoils the name of kerala restaurants and kerala food..ordered before twice and got negative experience but gave a try to their tambaram take away..these people do not know how to make a simple egg curry and appam..appam was sour and egg currry was like tomato and chilly paste..

Review 5:
Under cooked kerlaa rice. Atleast two prestige cooker whistles has to be blown before eating the left over rice from the lunch. Sambar was good. Yellow curry (sour) was good, side dishes were good. Packing was good. Marking low cos No sweet provided in the lunch and under cooked rice spoil3e the whole part


Reviews for Svk Naachiyar Chettinad Food Restaurant Veg and Non Veg:
Review 1:
I am a regular customer to this shop for about 3 years.
But today (Oct 4th 2023) they just disappointed me. I bought 3 parota parcel. 1 out of the 3 was old one which was prepared the day before.
Do you think customers are fools and you can cheat them by mixing old food items with new one?

Review 2:
Please improve food quality and quantity prices too much then tastewise it's okay please improve taste

Review 3:
It's perfect for street food lovers.

Especially if you are looking for a late night dinner, you can visit this hotel.

Small but good enough space to accommodate a small crowd. Fast response from the staff and they provide orders as quickly as possible.

The serving time depends a bit on the crowd. It's usually crowded after evening. But fast moving crowd and all are served at a reasonable time.

I'd recommend this place for a quick hot quality meal within a low budget.

Review 4:
Very nice non veg food is available

Review 5:
Cost effective, best in the locality, very near to road and bit of dusty environment ( only saviour is road before it is damaged for so many years and all vehicles go slowly, otherwise won't recommend)


Reviews for J.R.Jana Restaurant:
Review 1:
The Quality of JR Jana food has come down. We had taken their catering service in 2016 for our home ceremony and that time it was really nice. Now today we had our dinner but the quality of food is not the same as we had felt earlier .

Review 2:
I recently visited JR Jana Restaurant, and I must say that I was thoroughly disappointed with my experience. The food was below average, and the service was extremely slow. The staff seemed uninterested in providing us with a pleasant dining experience, and we were left waiting for long periods of time before anyone even acknowledged our presence.

The restaurant itself was also quite unclean, with dirty floors and tables that were not properly wiped down. The ambiance was lackluster, and it felt as if no effort was put into creating a welcoming atmosphere for customers.

Overall, I would not recommend JR Jana Restaurant to anyone. There are plenty of other dining options available in the area that offer better food, service, and ambiance. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this restaurant at all costs.

Review 5:
Food was okay, we tried gobi pudina which was bit too salty for our liking.
Fried rice had veggies cooked too much and missed the crispy half cooked feel.
Otherwise, the service was very good. Have tired only once. May give it a try.
